Project: Sockets

Description:
Task is to establish a successful connection to the server at cs5700sp15.ccs.neu.edu using sockets and evaluate all the expressions sent by the server to obtain the secret flag.
We used python to write the program and our first goal was to establish a succesful connection.We used the socket module provided by python to establish the connection.
Our next goal was to evaluate the received expression.We used the built in method eval to evaluate the received expression.Even though eval is not a safe option to use, we made sure the input provided was a valid one by checking the format and making it assert an error in case of an invalid expression.
The last goal was to handle the command line arguments and all the different combination of possible inputs.We also handled the erroneous possibilities and made our program terminate with an error message in case of an erroneous input.
Finally the extra credit task to implement SSL. We used the ssl module provided by python to wrap the socket object using a SSL wrapper.
